Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Q: How do I manually change the number of hits?
A: Once you have included the counter on your page, a file named
   pagename.xml will be created in the data directory. Simply edit 
   this file with a text editor and change the number located inside 
   the <total> and </total>

Q: Why is the script is not working or not working correctly?
A: If you are using this script in a Microsoft Windows server environment, 
   please ensure all the paths in the configurable variables are full 
   system paths, eg. c:\. Also be sure you are using double-backslashes, 
   eg. \\ instead of forward slashes.

Q: Why am I getting errors about flock?
A: If you are not running this script in a Unix/Linux environent,
   you will sometimes need to comment out (put a # in front of the line) the 
   file locking subroutines...

   use Fcntl ':flock';
   flock(XML, LOCK_UN);
   flock(XML, LOCK_EX);


Q: Why aren't the referrer stats or search terms showing up?
A: Either you haven't had any referrs or, if you are using the GD 
   version of the counter, the stats will not show up.

Q: The counter showing up on my page or i am getting an error?
A: If you are using the SSI version, most hosting providers will 
   requre you to rename the page from name.html or name.htm to
   name.shtml. If you are getting an error, check the virtual path 
   on the <!--#exec vitual= bit.

Q: How can make the counter invisible?
A: If you are using the GD version of the counter, you can set the 
   width and height in the image tag to 1. If you are using the SSI 
   version of the counter, you can place an html comment around it..
   <!-- <!--#exec virtual=""--> -->

Q: Why aren't any of the images showing up?
A: Some hosting providers do not allow anything but cgi scripts in 
   the cgi-bin directory, try putting the .cgi files and data 
   directory in the cgi bin, and moving the images elsewhere.
