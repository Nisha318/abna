Hi,

My name is Dave and I'm a BSCounter user.  I'm going to give you the steps I
took to install and run BSCounters on my web site.

Unzip the bscounter distribution to a convenient place.  Under the top
directory, you'll find 4 subdirectories.  They are bscounter-common,
bscounter-info-for-you, cgi-bin, and php-bin.  Copy these directories (ftp) to
your base directory in your web site.  If you already have a cgi-bin or php-bin
directory, that's okay because the bscounter code is in its own subdirectory.

The counter can be implemented on your site in one of 2 ways, either cgi or php
driven.  Your choice will depend mainly on your preference for page file types.
These will be .shtml files for the cgi driven implementation, or .php files for
the php driven implementation.  Regardless of choice, you need to do 3 things
to use the BSCounter after deciding on your page type.


1)

You probably have an index.html or similar file for your entry page.  My
suggestion is that you change the name of that file to a page name and write
a new index.html file that simply calls that original page.  This allows you to
use either the cgi or php option without affecting your generic entry file.  I
renamed my file welcome.php (choosing the php implementation).  I then wrote a
new, very simple, index.html:

<html>
  <meta name="description" content=
    " <!-- enter your description of your site --> ">
  <meta name="Keywords" content=
    " <!-- enter your list of keywords for your site -->">
  <title><!-- your page title --></title>
  <frameset />
  <frame src="welcome.php" />
</html>

Now, similarly rename all your other page files and change any references
within them to the original .html names to .php names, with the special case
of (in my example) changing all references to index.html to welcome.php.

If you chose the cgi implementation, the procedure is exactly the same, just
substitute '.shtml' for '.php'.

Now your site has been "normalized", that is, you can now add bscounter code to
your page files and have it execute correctly.


2)

Now, run the setup of the implementation you have chosen, in my case, it is:

http://mysite/php-bin/bscounter-php/setup.php

This presents a page for you to chose counter type (e.g., text, image, etc.),
a name for the counter to make it unique (for me, I just used the name of the
page, 'welcome'), and a style of counter (e.g., LED, blushdw, etc.).  Once
you've made your choices, submit them and the next page will present you with
the code you need to cut'n'paste into your page file.

The php implementation uses 2 lines of code.  The first line is in the form of
an include directive for the file containing the counter functions.  This is
placed (typically) as the first line of your page file.  The code would look
something like:

<?php include("php-bin/bscounter-php/count.php"); ?>

The second line of code to cut'n'paste is the call to the counter itself.  This
you place in the position in your code where you want the counter to show up.
A typical piece of code might look something like:


                <center>
                <?php
                  echo("This page visited  ");
                  bscounter("welcome", "image", "blushdw", "png", 1, 1);
                  echo("  times.");
                ?>
                </center>


But the code you will actually be given to paste will be:

<?php bscounter("welcome", "image", "blushdw", "png", 1, 1); ?>

The modifications in the example were mine, but may be typical.

NOTE:  These insertions go into the individual page's code file.

The cgi implementation is identical, excepting that you only place one line
of code, the counter itself, in your page file, which of course has .shtml as
an extension.  This cut'n'paste code would typically look like:

<!--#include virtual=
  "/cgi-bin/bscounter-perl/count.cgi?page=
    welcome&style=blushdw&type=image&reloads=1"-->


3)

Now you should have your counter on your page and you can view the statistics
for it with the stat.xxx (xxx is cgi or php), e.g.:

http://mysite/php-bin/bscounter-php/stat.php&page=welcome



And there you are!;)
