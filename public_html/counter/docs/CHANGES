Changes in version 2
--------------------

- Most of the code has been redone
	+ Submit bugs, optimizations, improvements to brian@stanback.net
- Separated counter code from the stats code (count.cgi does count, stats.cgi does stats)
- New format for storing data (XML)
	+ If you want to retain your previous stats, use the update.pl script to convert an old format data file to the new format
	+ Created weed.pl file to periodically clean out the xml file (view README)
	+ The new format is also easier to edit, and allows one to change the total hits without skewing the stats
- Added templates for the stats and setup pages
- Changed last 20 referrers to top 20
- Added prelimenary search engine terms support
	+ The script should be albe to get the  search terms from altavista, alltheweb, teoma, google, hotbot, lycos, mixcat, yahoo, and probably others
- New setup.cgi script
	+ This simply aides in generating the SSI or IMG tag code to place in a user's html document
- No option of formatting the text-based counter
	+ Changing font size, weight, and face can all be done in the user's html and shouldn't be part of the counter
- New query string varible names
	+ file= has changed to name=
	+ type=g has changed to type=image (for image counter) (for text counter, just drop the type=) 
- Changed the way the script parses config variables sent via the query string
	+ For security reasons, only letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes will not be stripped from query string variable values
- Fixed the file locking (flock)
- Added new top-level domains
	+ Counter also only shows the top 20 countries
- Redid browser/os detection
	+ Send additions to brian@stanback.net
- Optional digit size arguments can be added to the query string for the GD counter
	+ By specifying x=digitxpixels and y=digitypixels on the query string, the script doesn't have to waste time opening the dim file, located in each digit directory, to get the proper dimensions
- Added option to block hits from the counter owner
